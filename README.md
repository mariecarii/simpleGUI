## Project Description
This project's goal was to introduce myself to java GUI and create my first one. 

## Languages
Java

## How to Run
Open in your IDE. Run. The GUI will pop up.

## How to Use
This was a very simple, introductory project so it's only function is to increment the count each time the button is clicked.

## Future Plans
This was just the start of my java GU journey and I plan on taking a deeper dive.
